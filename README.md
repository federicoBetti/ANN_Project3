Descrizione progetto
Implemented the Reinforcement Learning algorithm called REINFORCE (with simple or adaptive baseline) algorithm using Neural Networks. The challenge used was the Lunar Lander provided by OpenAi Gym (https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) but the concept can be enlarged to other challenges of OpenAi. The code is in a Jupyter Notebook now, I'll provide the normal python code as soon as possible.
